# Case-2 Siemens Sales Forecast

## Introduction  
This project focuses on developing a sales forecasting model for Siemens using historical sales data. By leveraging data science techniques, we aim to create a predictive model that provides accurate sales estimates, helping Siemens optimize decision-making and resource allocation. The dataset spans 2.5 years of sales records, and our approach involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and the application of machine learning models to enhance forecast accuracy.
